## The Process: Restoring Identity to the Lost

The excavation and identification of victims from the Jeju 4.3 Incident is a profound and meticulous process aimed at restoring the names and dignity of those killed and buried without recognition decades ago. It is not merely a scientific procedure but, as my own research frames it, a "memorial practice". The work is a state-led project to heal the wounds of the past and provide closure to families who have waited over 70 years.

The process unfolds in several critical stages:

- Historical Research and Testimony: Before any digging begins, extensive research is conducted using historical records and, most importantly, the testimonies of survivors and local residents. This helps pinpoint the locations of clandestine mass graves or single unmarked burials.

- Meticulous Excavation (Exhumation): Once a site is identified, a team of archaeologists and forensic experts carefully excavates the area. This is a delicate, respectful process to recover the human remains with the utmost care, ensuring no evidence is lost.

- Forensic and DNA Analysis: The recovered remains are transferred to a laboratory. Forensic anthropologists analyze the bones to determine basic information like age, sex, and evidence of trauma. Crucially, samples are taken from teeth or dense bone for DNA extraction.

- Identification and Return: The extracted DNA profile is compared against a database of DNA provided by the bereaved families. A successful match officially restores a victim's identity. The final, most important step is the solemn return of the remains to the family, allowing them to finally hold a proper funeral and lay their loved one to rest in peace.

My Role as Project Manager

As the project manager for the human remains excavation and identification projects at the Jeju 4.3 Peace Foundation, my role was to oversee this entire complex and sensitive operation from start to finish. This involved more than just logistics; it required a deep integration of historical research, forensic science, and compassionate engagement with the bereaved community.

My key responsibilities included:

Strategic Coordination: I served as the central point of contact between multiple teams, including historical researchers, on-site excavation crews, forensic anthropologists, DNA analysis labs, and government officials.

Oversight of Field and Lab Work: I actively managed the on-site excavation projects and the subsequent DNA identification process, ensuring that every stage was conducted ethically, scientifically, and with the profound respect the victims deserved.

Sensitive Data Management: The project involved handling highly sensitive data, from the location of remains to the genetic information of victims and their families. I was responsible for ensuring this information was managed securely and confidentially.

Community and Family Liaison: A crucial part of my role was communicating with the elderly survivors and bereaved families. This involved explaining the process, managing expectations, and providing support during the emotionally charged identification and return of remains.
