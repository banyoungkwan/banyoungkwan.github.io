Archival Research for the National Follow-up Investigation

A core component of my role at the Jeju 4.3 Peace Foundation was to conduct extensive archival research for the official national 'follow-up investigation' into the Jeju 4.3 Incident. The primary objective of this project was to build a more comprehensive and multi-faceted historical record by going beyond previously examined domestic sources. To achieve this, my work integrated two crucial methodologies: rigorous investigation in international archives and the deeply personal work of collecting victim testimonies from survivors and their families.

A major focus of this project was my research at the U.S. National Archives. Because the U.S. Military Government was in power in southern Korea when the uprising began, its records hold a critical perspective on the event. My work there involved meticulously identifying, analyzing, and contextualizing declassified military reports, intelligence documents, and diplomatic cables. This international research was vital for understanding the U.S. role, its awareness of the unfolding atrocities, and its influence on the actions of the South Korean forces.

This multi-sited archival work was targeted at researching and providing evidence on several critical aspects of the incident for the national investigation. The findings were instrumental in shaping the official report and clarifying the complex dynamics of the tragedy. My key areas of research included:

- State Responsibility: Investigating the chain of command within the military and police to establish official accountability for the violence and human rights violations that occurred.

- Military and Police Brutality: Systematically documenting patterns and specific instances of violence committed by state forces against civilians, moving beyond anecdotal evidence to build a body of verifiable proof.

- Enforced Migration: Researching the mass displacement of Jeju residents who were forced to flee their homes and communities as a direct result of the violence and suppression campaign.
