As an accomplished Human Rights Researcher and Memory Studies Scholar, I have dedicated my career to the in-depth investigation and documentation of historical human rights violations. My work bridges the gap between past injustices and contemporary understanding, focusing on how societies remember and address their most difficult histories. This scholarly pursuit is driven by a deep commitment to uncovering silenced narratives and ensuring that historical truths are acknowledged and preserved for future generations.

My expertise is rooted in the meticulous and often challenging processes of truth-seeking. This includes extensive archival research and the professional handling of sensitive data related to state-level atrocities. A critical component of my work involves tangible processes like victim identification, which restores dignity to those who have been lost to history. Furthermore, my efforts have contributed to the global preservation of memory through the successful registration of UNESCO Documentary heritage, ensuring these vital records are protected and made accessible.

Fundamentally, I am committed to advancing human rights through rigorous research, comprehensive documentation, and steadfast advocacy for accountability. I believe that a thorough understanding of the past is essential for building a more just future. Moving forward, I am seeking to leverage my unique insights to make impactful contributions to the field of human rights, working towards a world where accountability is upheld and the lessons of history inform a more humane present.
