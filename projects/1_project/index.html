This inscription marks a pivotal moment, transforming a once-suppressed local history into a recognized part of our shared global heritage. The archives—comprising survivor testimonies, official documents, victim lists, and records of the truth-seeking movement—tell the story of immense suffering and an arduous, decades-long path toward justice.</p> <p>The purpose of seeking UNESCO recognition extended far beyond mere preservation. For decades, the history of Jeju 4.3 was officially silenced. Therefore, the primary goal was to secure irreversible, global acknowledgment of the victims’ suffering and the legitimacy of their long struggle for the truth. Inscription by UNESCO serves as a powerful bulwark against denial and historical revisionism, ensuring the tragedy can never again be erased or ignored. It affirms that the lessons learned from Jeju 4.3—about the dangers of state violence, the abuse of ideology, and the profound human need for truth and reconciliation—are of universal value to all of humanity.</p> <p>The path to this inscription was a testament to the power of collective will, representing a culmination of efforts by survivors, bereaved families, civic organizations, and researchers. As someone who was directly involved in the practical work of drafting the UNESCO Memory of the World application for these historical materials, I witnessed this process firsthand. It was a meticulous undertaking that involved systematically compiling, organizing, and articulating the universal significance of these diverse records. We had to demonstrate not only their authenticity and historical importance but also their role as a symbol of courage for communities worldwide that have suffered similar atrocities.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Postcards from the Prison" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Testimonies collected by Oh Sung-chan" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Victim reports submitted to the Jeju Provincial Assembly" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As the project manager for the UNESCO inscription initiative, I began working in partnership with the Jeju 4.3 Peace Foundation in 2019 to formally prepare the application. My leadership role was comprehensive, encompassing the foundational work of organizing the vast archival records, launching a public campaign to collect private historical materials, curating major exhibitions to showcase these records, and hosting a series of pivotal academic events.</p> <p>Under my management, the project progressed through several key phases to build momentum and solidify the application.</p> <ul> <li> <p>We began by hosting an International Symposium on the Memory of the World in December 2019.</p> </li> <li> <p>A significant effort was dedicated to expanding the archive; our public campaign from August to October 2020 successfully collected approximately 400 new private records.</p> </li> <li> <p>From December 2020 to August 2021, I oversaw the special exhibition, “Traces Becoming Records,” to share our findings with the public.</p> </li> <li> <p>Throughout 2021 and 2022, we recorded crucial video testimonies from key figures involved in the truth-finding movement.</p> </li> <li> <p>We continued to foster dialogue through academic events, including the Jeju 4.3 Peace Forum in October 2021 and a final symposium in December 2022 focused on the inscription push.</p> </li> <li> <p>I then worked with the formal application process, from the initial submission to the Korean National Commission for UNESCO in February 2023, through its successful domestic approval in October 2023, to the final submission to UNESCO Headquarters in November 2023.</p> </li> <li> <p>To support the final international review, we took the story of Jeju 4.3 abroad, holding overseas symposiums in Berlin and London in October 2024.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The announcement of the successful registration was made at April 11, 2025, decided by the UNESCO Board Meeting.</p> <p>Here’s how the UNESCO describes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The archives consist of 14,673 documents related to Jeju 4·3, an armed uprising led by the Jeju branch of South Korean Labor Party on 3 April, 1948. This event escalated into guerrilla warfare, resulting in massive atrocities inflicted upon innocent inhabitants. These archives preserve suppressed memories of Korea’s post-colonial transition, highlighting endeavours to rehabilitate the honour of victims who had long suffered the stigma associated with communism. The archives also focus on collective efforts to embrace those who had once been perpetrators, fostering a vision of Jeju as a community of coexistence. The archives portray the achievements of the local community’s grassroots democratic efforts in advancing reconciliation and restoration.

It ensures that the voices from this small island will now contribute permanently to the global conversation on peace, human rights, and the ethics of memory. It is a solemn promise that these records of pain will serve as a beacon of hope and a lesson for generations to come.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Youngkwan Ban.
