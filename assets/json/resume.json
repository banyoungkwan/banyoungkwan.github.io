      "summary": "In this article, I observe the way Bongha, a small town of South Korea, constructs the tourist experience, using continually maintained silence regarding certain aspects of the past. The town became famous after the former president Moo-hyun Roh committed a politically controversial suicide in 2009. Then Bongha serves as memory-dispositif, putting forward memory aids for Roh that are chosen to highlight his life selectively."

      "summary": "This article examines the exhumation and identification process conducted at Jeju International Airport to search for the Jeju 4.3 victims who have been missing for more than 70 years. The discovery of a thousand intricate bones beneath the airport's surface shattered the imagined anonymity and uniformity of the space, revealing a profound connection to memory and history. I argue that this project shed light on the relationships among human remains, memory, and history, uncovering critical evidence of extreme violence and providing a platform to address the unspoken wounds of the community."
